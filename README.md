# NeuroRG
This repository contains codes for evaluating the methodology with the model introduced in the "NeuroRG(tentative title)" paper.

## Introduction
A comprehensive comprehension of cellular morphology and behavior holds paramount importance, particularly in the examination of disorders associated with the brain. Nevertheless, the analysis of the configurations and attributes of brain cells has proven to be a formidable task. Despite the application of advanced methodologies such as deep learning, challenges persist, including the necessity for a substantial amount of labeled data, the intricacy of discerning subtle cellular changes, and variations in experimental conditions.

Our research is dedicated to surmounting these challenges, specifically within the realm of neuroinflammation, an inflammatory process occurring in the brain. Leveraging proprietary data and employing a deep learning approach, we have successfully scrutinized the morphologies of both nerve and immune cells, both under pathological conditions and subsequent to pharmacological interventions. This innovative methodology enhances our understanding of neuroinflammation and facilitates the evaluation of potential treatments, thereby addressing a void in the exploration of brain disorders and the advancement of novel pharmaceuticals.

## Results
### Model & Accuracy

The above figures illustrate the accuracy benchmark metrics of the top-performing deep learning model and presents the image classification results for the 6 classes of the most efficient model, EfficientNetB5, in the form of a confusion matrix.

### Channel Comparison

Additionally, the above images convey information about a similarity analysis using Pearson correlation. It compares predictions generated by combining three channels with those obtained from each individual channel. Each data point on the scatter plot represents the predicted probability of control for each well.

## Setup
All the code was run under Python 3.10.6. If using conda, our recommended settings are as follows:
```
> conda create -n neurorg python=3.10.6
> conda activate neurorg
(neurorg) > pip install -r dependencies.txt
```

## Data Availability
Cropped image data set is available in the form of numpy arrays on Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10369052), and ownership of all data is explicitly stated to belong to DR.NOAHBIOTECH.
