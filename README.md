# NeuroRG
This repository contains codes for evaluating the methodology with the model introduced in the "NeuroRG(tentative title)" paper.

## Introduction
Comprehending the structure and behavior of cells is of paramount importance, particularly in the investigation of brain-related disorders. However, the analysis of the morphology and characteristics of brain cells poses significant challenges. Despite the utilization of advanced techniques such as deep learning, obstacles persist, including the requirement for substantial labeled data, the intricacy of detecting subtle cellular changes, and variations in experimental conditions.

Our research is dedicated to overcoming these challenges, specifically within the context of neuroinflammation, an inflammatory process occurring in the brain. By leveraging proprietary data and employing a deep learning approach, we have effectively scrutinized the morphologies of both nerve and immune cells, both under pathological conditions and subsequent to pharmacological interventions. This innovative methodology enhances our understanding of neuroinflammation and facilitates the evaluation of potential treatments, thereby addressing a void in the exploration of brain disorders and the advancement of novel pharmaceuticals.

## Results
### Model & Accuracy

The above figures illustrate the accuracy benchmark metrics of the top-performing deep learning model and presents the image classification results for the 6 classes of the most efficient model, EfficientNetB5, in the form of a confusion matrix.

### Channel Comparison

Additionally, the above images convey information about a similarity analysis using Pearson correlation. It compares predictions generated by combining three channels with those obtained from each individual channel. Each data point on the scatter plot represents the predicted probability of control for each well.

## Setup
Please download the image dataset saved in .npy format from Zenodo, reconfigure the data path in the src/driver.ipynb Jupyter notebook, and then execute the notebook.


All the code was run under Python 3.10.6. If using conda, our recommended settings are as follows:
```
> conda create -n neurorg python=3.10.6
> conda activate neurorg
(neurorg) > pip install -r dependencies.txt
```

## Data Availability
Cropped image data set is available in the form of numpy arrays on Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10369052), and ownership of all data is explicitly stated to belong to DR.NOAHBIOTECH.
